## Reflections
This chess game was made as the final project for The Odin Project's ruby course. I learned a lot from this and it took me a lot more time than I hoped it would. It would have been a lot easier had I included RSpec tests instead of manually testing the game on the command line. Another way I could have improved is by planning out my code beforehand a lot more instead of just very briefly. Overall, however, this project along with the many others throughout this course have given me a great understanding of ruby. I am very excited to expand my knowledge of this language when I continue with the rails course.
