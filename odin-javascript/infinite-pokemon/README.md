# infinite-pokemon

This project uses HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX to access a 3rd-party API. It was based off a project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript-and-jquery/lessons/infinite-scroll-and-submitting-a-form-with-ajax). It does not directly follow the project guidelines because the site that had been used in the project limited its API at the time to people who were on a paid subscription. A big thank you to [Pokéapi V2](https://pokeapi.co/), a RESTful and free Pokémon API. I recommend you check it out if you ever have educational projects similar to this one.
