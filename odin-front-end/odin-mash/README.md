# odin-mash

This is a CSS3 framework created for The Odin Project's HTML and CSS course. This was the final project and a better description of the goals can be found on the project page [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/design-your-own-grid-based-framework).

## Description

This framework uses a 8-column grid and has additional styles as well. It uses Eric Myer's CSS Reset 2.0 and is a very simple CSS framework. This bare-bone approach makes the setup process a bit less tedious, while allowing the user to not have to worry about overwriting other styles.
