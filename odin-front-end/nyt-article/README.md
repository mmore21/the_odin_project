# nyt-article

This project uses HTML5 and CSS3 to create a mock-layout of a New York Times article. I used different background colors to show the difference in the positioning and sizing of each core element that makes up the page. I did not go as far as to actually style and create a replica-version of the site because I have already done two site-replicas and that is not the main goal of the project. This short project helped me improve my knowledge of positioning elements greatly and I will continue to use these techniques in the future.

This project was made for The Odin Project's HTML/CSS course and was entirely for educational purposes. The official project can be viewed [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements).
