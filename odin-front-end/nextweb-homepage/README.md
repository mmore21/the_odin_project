# nextweb-homepage

This project works on creating a responsive front-end mock of The Next Web landing page. It uses HTML5 and vanilla CSS3 to keep things simple. It is solely for educational purposes and the project page can be found on The Odin Project's [website](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-responsive-design).
