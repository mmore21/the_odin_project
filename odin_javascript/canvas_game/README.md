#simple-canvas-game

This project uses HTML5's Canvas and JavaScript + jQuery to create a very minimal canvas game. It was made using a tutorial from [Lost Decade Games](http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/). This was also for educational purposes as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript-and-jquery/lessons/building-games-with-canvas), although I went a different route for this project.
