# smashing-homepage

The idea behind this front-end only mock-up site was to create a heat map of the content areas on Smashing Magazine's homepage which drew the most attention from the eye. It also practices using external fonts exported from Google Fonts and aligning 'div' elements. This project was made for The Odin Project's HTML/CSS curriculum and is for educational purposes only.
