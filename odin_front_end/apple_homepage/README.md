# apple-homepage

This project is a front-end clone of one of Apple's old homepages. It uses just HTML5 and CSS3 and is solely for educational purposes.

This was part of The Odin Project's HTML & CSS course. View the full project page [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients).
